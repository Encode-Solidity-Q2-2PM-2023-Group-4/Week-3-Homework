# Week 3 Homework

This week, we were tasked with editing a tokenized ballot contract in solidity and deploying both the voting token and ballot contracts with TypeScript. Once these contracts were deployed, we had to mint a/some voting token(s), transfer them between ourselves and vote. After this had been done, we could check the outcome of the ballot. Task completed by:

## Timeline

### Token Deployment

The token, a mintable ERC20 with voting rights and roles, was deployed at [0xe5f...578](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xe5fe97615b9509da6bf2bfaa5f7bc8a33598a802fa7b1a212766cf61f4aae578) on the Sepolia testnet. From this point, the deployer can mint and transfer tokens between other members of the group.

### Token Minting

Then, one MyToken (MTK) was minted by the deployer in transaction hash [0x76f...8ef](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x76f9d583b2e99018b783d3f4943f00e220d596aff8fccf367830320007eeb8ef), to be split into four and transferred to the rest of the team:
