# Week 3 Homework

This week, we were tasked with editing a tokenized ballot contract in solidity and deploying both the voting token and ballot contracts with TypeScript. Once these contracts were deployed, we had to mint a/some voting token(s), transfer them between ourselves and vote. After this had been done, we could check the outcome of the ballot.
